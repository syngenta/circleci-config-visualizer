# Contribution Guide
We want to make contributing to this repo as easy and transparent as possible.

So let's go:

1. **Pushing directly to main branch isn't allowed.** Before contributing, make sure you are creating a new branch and making changes there. The branch name should be in this format:
**`Feature/Bug_fix-Title_of_the_feature_or_bug_fix`**\
For example: `Feature-Added_Custom_Nodes`, `Bug_fix-Workflow_Node_fix`. These are some valid branching names which would help us understand your contributions better.

2. Add meaningful descriptions in your PRs to get a clear idea about the changes you are making.

3. We welcome any type of contribution(s), but any contribution(s) you make will be under the MIT software license!

4. Consider using Nodejs version `16` to avoid any further and existing dependency issues.

5. When submitting a bug, try to include a detailed description including the situation when it occurrs, the files or part of code causing it (if able to find), etc.



### Your Ideas are always welcomed! 💡
